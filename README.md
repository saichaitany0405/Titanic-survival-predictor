#  Titanic Survival Predictor

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using Logistic Regression.

---

## Project Overview

Using the Titanic dataset, this model predicts whether a passenger would survive or not based on features like class, age, gender, fare, and port of embarkation.

## Dataset

Located in the `data/` folder:

- `train.csv` - Training data
- `test.csv` - Testing data
- `gender_submission.csv` - Sample submission file from Kaggle
